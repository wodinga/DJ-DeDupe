# DJ-DeDupe

This is a quick personal project that I made to de duplicate my DJ library folder. Some songs were duplicated as m4as vs mp3s, or the files were duplicated (file, file 1, file 2...)

Took longer than I thought, and Apple's changed to async/await in swift which I'll have to read up more about at some point.
